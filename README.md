# Minesweeper
This Minesweeper project features various algorithms and functionality to improve the gameplay experience, including a double shuffle algorithm for randomizing mine placement, a BFS algorithm for revealing adjacent zero tiles, the ability to place flags and check game status, and four different difficulty levels. Players can click on tiles to reveal them, place flags on potential mine locations, and navigate the game board using WASD keys. Error messages are provided for invalid actions and the game board can be printed with or without visibility masks for visited and flagged tiles. The game also allows players to start a new game and exit the game at any time.
